## Install

Run:
```sh
./install.sh
```

If the egg icon doesn't appear in the panel, run `tail -f ~/.xsession-errors` to see if there were any errors.

---

## Development

Run:
```sh
./dist/app.py --logging=info
```
If it shows up in your Panel, success! Otherwise run `tail -f ~/.xsession-errors` to see if there were any errors.


### Gtk Inspector

To view Gtk component hiearchies and style classes/names, you'll need the `GtkInspector`.

```sh
# If `libgtk-3-dev` isn't installed, do so
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev

# Enable with
gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding true
```

With an App/Window focused, hit `CTRL+SHIFT+I` and it should open with that App's items listed in the Objects view. Click on the lightbulb icon to `Show Details`, then click the drop-down and select `CSS nodes`.


### Sound Creation

I converted a system sound to a `.wav` so Alsa could play it.
```sh
# -ac 1     (convert to mono)
# -ar 8000  (bitrate, roughly 8khz)
ffmpeg -acodec libvorbis -i "/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga" -ac 1 -ar 8000 "./dist/complete.wav"
```


### Thread Check

To ensure Threads are being torn down:
```sh
# Get the PID from System Monitor.
ps -T -p <PID>

# Count the number of items before you start running a Timer, then after a Timer
# has started. After the Timer has completed, the number of items should reset.
# A new Thread will show up in the CMD column under `<NAME>.py` (NAME being the
# script that started the Thread).
```
